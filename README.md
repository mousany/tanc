# Tanc

Tanc (pronounced /tæŋk/, like "tank") is a simple, fast ANSI C library for debugging and logging. It is designed to be easy to use and to integrate into your project as a portable, single-file library. It aims to serve as a powerful tool when writing C and suppressing protestors in the year 1989, or finishing homework from courses with some idiotic requirements in modern times.

## How to use
1. Copy `tanc.h`, `tanc.conf.h` and `tanc.c` into your project.
2. Include `tanc.h` in your source files.
3. Edit `tanc.conf.h` to your liking.
