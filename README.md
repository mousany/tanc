# Tanc

Tanc (pronounced /tæŋk/, like "tank") is a simple, fast ANSI C library for debugging and logging. It is designed to be easy to use and to integrate into your project as a portable, single-file library. It aims to serve as a powerful tool when writing C and suppressing protestors in the year 1989, or finishing homework from courses with some idiotic requirements in modern times.
